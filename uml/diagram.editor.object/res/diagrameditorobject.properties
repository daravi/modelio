CreationWizard.Object.Details                       = Objects diagrams are used to provide instance models of classifiers (classes, components, etc.).\nThey can be created in the context of a classifier (internal structure of a class) or collaboration, and also under a package.\nYou can create an instance model to represent existing instances, and then abstract them as classes. You can also illustrate a class model by providing a typical instance configuration: in that case classes and attributes pre-exist to instances.\nUnder a classifier, the object diagram represents parts of the classifier : generally, composite diagrams which show ports and connectors are preferred in this case.
